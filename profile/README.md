Welcome to Geovistory Organization.

We develop and maintain Geovistory, an open source, community driven virtual research environment and data publication platform.
 
The Geovistory information system has two browser-based access points. The first is the data publication platform Geovistory.org. Here, researchers and the larger public can review projects, directly access and evaluate curated data. The publication platform is designed in such a way that any software engineer can develop and integrate own components (web components). The second access point is the Geovistory Toolbox, a virtual research environment, where researchers collect, curate and evaluate data.
 
Geovistory furthermore consists of an active community , which constantly develops and documents its components.
